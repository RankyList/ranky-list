            Dear RankyList user, Thank you for visiting our website. We apologize for any inconvenience, but it appears that Javascript is currently
            disabled in your web browser.
        </p>

        Javascript is a programming language that is used to enhance the functionality and user experience of websites. To fully utilize the features
        of RankyList, including Single Page Application (SPA) functionality, drag and drop, dark mode, and more, it is necessary to have Javascript
        enabled.
    </p>
    <p class="unstyled">
        Single Page Applications (SPAs) are a type of web application that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the page as the user
        interacts with the app, rather than reloading the page from the server. This provides a more seamless and responsive user experience, as the
        app can load and update content without requiring a full page reload. It also helps saving data during navigation.
    </p>
    <p class="unstyled">
        Please be assured that we do not use Javascript to include any ads or steal data. We rely on it to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience
        for our users.
    </p>
    <p class="unstyled">
        If you would like to enable Javascript, please follow the instructions on
        <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this website</a>. It provides a helpful guide on how to
        do so for various web browsers.
    </p>
    <p class="unstyled">Thank you for your understanding and we hope you have a great experience using RankyList.</p>
    <p class="unstyled">Sincerely, The RankyList Team</p>
